Description: To address the problem of insecurity of UDP-based DNS requests,
    Google Public DNS offers DNS resolution over an encrypted HTTPS
    connection. DNS-over-HTTPS greatly enhances privacy and security
    between a client and a recursive resolver, and complements DNSSEC
    to provide end-to-end authenticated DNS lookups. Functions that enable
    querying individual requests that bulk requests that return detailed
    responses and bulk requests are both provided. Support for reverse
    lookups is also provided.
